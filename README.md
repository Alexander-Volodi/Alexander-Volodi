### Hello, I'm Alexander Volodin
I learn to programm. I make and explore games, make web-sites. I'm programming site for my school with my friends for this and previos year.
I'm interested in math, especially geometry and graphs. In the next year I will have been learning mathematical analysis linear algebra until the end of the school which are beautiful at first sight. 
So I would like to try this in my programming. I believe my skills will be needful for society.
